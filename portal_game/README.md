# Personal Project

Hi there! THis is my first personal project where I recreate the Valve puzzle based video game Portal into a 2d maze game. Made without a game engine, the game operates in real time 

Implemented with Observer, Observeable and Composite design patterns. Try/Catch Exceptions and JUnit tests written for more robust coding. 

Rules: 
Navigate your character (Atlas) through the maze by reaching the pink checkpoint. Use your portal gun, to teleport through previously unaccessible parts of the maze. Please note that walking through Lava does kill you! (Wouldn't want to try that in real life either hehe) 

Controls: 

CHARACTER MOVEMENT:
Up: "w" // "Up-arrow-key"
Left: "a" // "Left-arrow-key"
Down: "s" // "Down-arrow-key"
Left: "d" // "Right-arrow-key"

PORTAL_GUN 
Fire OrangePortal "e"
Fire BluePortal  "q"

NEXT/PREVIOUS LEVEL 
Next Level: "m"
Previous Level: "n"

QUIT GAME
Quit "X"
